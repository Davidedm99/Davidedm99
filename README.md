# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

<h2>About Me</h2>
Hi! My name is Davide Di Marco, I'm 23 years old, I was born in the little city of Lanciano(CH) but I'm currenty based in Milan. <br>
I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano. I love learning new things and use my knowledge to develop useful and silly projects.
I mainly use GitHub to store and easily manage all the projects I work on. :octocat: <br>
Some of them might be basic and not impressing at all, but everyone need to start from somewhere :man_shrugging: <br>

<h2>Collab repositories</h2>

I worked With [Giacomo Dell'Agosto](https://github.com/GiacomoDA) in a [Database Project](https://github.com/GiacomoDA/db2_jpa_project) for the Database II course. In this little project an Admin can create, modify or delete Telephone rates and check the interaction with the user, that was able to "buy" them, so that we could see the database response to the user's actions. <br>
I recently worked as a Level Designer and Programmer for [iEllows](https://github.com/iellows) in the developing of a Videogame called [The Feline Paradox](https://github.com/iellows/TheFelineParadox) using the Unity Engine. Here I also get used to Houdini 3D Procedural software for the creation of the buildings in each level.
